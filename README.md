# ToDo-List-Application

I developed a Command-Line Interface (CLI) To-Do List Application using Go (Golang) and SQLite as the database. This application allows users to efficiently manage their tasks, providing features such as:

1.User Authentication: Users can sign up or log in to access their personal task list.
2.Task Management: Users can view, add, and mark tasks as completed.
3. Persistent Data Storage: Tasks are stored securely in a relational SQLite database, ensuring persistence across sessions.

Highlights and Overview:
1. GORM Integration: Leveraged the powerful GORM library to simplify database interactions and enable auto-migration of schema changes, eliminating the need for manual updates.
2. Focus on User Experience: Designed an intuitive CLI flow to make task management straightforward for users.
3. Technical Proficiency: Demonstrated strong command over Go programming language, particularly in handling concurrency, file I/O, and structured programming.
Showcased my ability to work with SQLite, managing data relationships and enforcing constraints such as foreign keys.

Challenges and Solutions:
One of the challenges faced during development was managing schema migrations when working directly with SQLite. Transitioning to GORM resolved this by enabling seamless auto-migrations, which made the application more maintainable and scalable.

This To-Do List Application is a testament to my growing proficiency in Golang and SQLite, showcasing my ability to deliver practical solutions for real-world problems.
